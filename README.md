## What is Rocket-Leaf?

Rocket-Leaf is a **local desktop app** for connecting to and managing RocketMQ clusters. It helps you inspect topics, monitor consumers, query messages, and send test messages without deploying a web console or exposing management ports.

- **Ready to use**: download and launch directly
- **Cross-platform**: available on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Local-first data**: connection profiles stay on your machine and are easy to back up

## Features

| Capability | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Connection Management** | Add multiple clusters, switch quickly, and persist profiles locally |
| **Topics** | Browse, search, inspect details, create, and delete topics |
| **Consumer Groups** | View groups, inspect offsets, reset progress, and review subscriptions |
| **Messages** | Query by Topic / Key / MessageId, inspect details, send test messages, and view traces |
| **Monitoring** | Check cluster health, producer and consumer TPS, and backlog status |
